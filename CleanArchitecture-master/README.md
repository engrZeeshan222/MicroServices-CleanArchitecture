Our project architecture is structured into distinct layers, each serving a specific role in ensuring efficient functionality and maintainability. 
At its core, the Domain Layer defines the business logic and entities, while the Infrastructure Layer handles persistence technologies such as Entity 
Framework for database interactions. The Application Layer encapsulates the business logic, with clear separation of interfaces and implementations 
for ease of maintenance. The API Layer acts as the primary interface for user interaction, leveraging dependencies from both the Domain and Application
Layers to facilitate seamless data management. Additionally, the Shared Folder serves as a centralized repository for commonly used code snippets, 
promoting code reuse and maintainability across layers. Through this well-organized architecture, we establish a solid foundation for our project, 
enhancing reliability, scalability, and overall system performance.
